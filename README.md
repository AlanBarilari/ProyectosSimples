I have 2 projects that I built in Python using VSCode. One is the Game of Life (based on Conway's Game of Life, https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
and the other is a Snake game using images of one of my pets. In order to run the Snake game, you need to download the files from the 'file' folder since it contains the images for the game.
